<p class="p1">Greetings Internet,</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">My name is Alice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">我叫嘉欢.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I am delightedly to have this space carved out for myself on the World Wide Web.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The very first memory I have of sending out text documents out was on one of the very first laptops that Apple made called the iBook, through the very same TextEdit app that I am writing on now.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Over the history of the year 2000 to 2020, I have come into contact with several people online whom I admire, analyzing, discussing, and simply talking about the subject matter they find so invigorating they share in abundance.</p>
<p class="p3">I can confidently say I have that too.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Owing to the geographical frontiers I grew up in laden with rich biodiversity, I understood the wealth that came from natural landscapes.</p>
<p class="p3">I devoted 4 years of my undergraduate studies to understand what it takes to protect naturally occurring sources of wealth for a country like forests, land, and water.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">These resources are finite and are vulnerable to the calamitous changes of our climate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I believe that with increasing climate action, we can give justice to that unjustly devastated.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Storytelling is foundational to climate justice and underlines the importance of climate action.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">A climate communicator is <b>paramount.</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Apprehensive, jaded, but hopeful,</p>
<p class="p1">Alice in Vancouver</p>
