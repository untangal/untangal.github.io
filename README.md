# untangal.github.io
This is the bare bones of what will be my personal website.
I predict that it will continue to stay like this until I have a grasp of the technical jargon that comes with installing themes.

My domain name is untangaled.ca 
Untangaled is a portmanteau of my last name, Tang, and a shortened version of my nickname, Alice.
It's also a homophone of untangled as my website is a place for me to share who I am and what I do.
